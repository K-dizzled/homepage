This is a personal website of Andrei Kozyrev. It is built with Jekyll using the [Ghostly theme](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/ghostly?tab=readme-ov-file). I just removed the post functionality and made it into a single static page with a few sections. Thanks to @jonathanlilly for an amazing theme!
